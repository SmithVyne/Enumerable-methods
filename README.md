# Enumerable-methods

## Built With
- Ruby version 2.7.0


### Milestones

The purpose of this project is to build my own examples of some Enumerable methods. They are meant to work like the original Enumerable methods they represent. I built:

1. `my_each` method that works like the Ruby `each` method
2. `my_each_with_index` method also accordingly
3. `my_select` method
4. `my_all?` method
5. `my_any?` method
6. `my_none?` method
7. `my_count` method 
8. `my_map` method
9. `my_inject`
